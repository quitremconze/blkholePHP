## What is Atmosphere VST?
 
Atmosphere VST is a dream synth module that was released in 2002 by Spectrasonics, a renowned company in the audio industry. It features a huge library of over 1000 unique sounds, ranging from ethereal choirs and strings to futuristic synths and effects. You can mix and match these sounds using the intuitive interface, which offers a multi-mode resonant filter, an envelope generator, an LFO, and a modulation matrix. You can also layer up to four sounds together for more complex sonic combinations.
 
Atmosphere VST is compatible with Windows and Mac platforms, and works as a standalone application or as a plugin in any VST host. It supports 16-bit and 24-bit audio formats, and can be synced to your host tempo for rhythmic effects.
 
## How to Create Atmospheric Sounds with Atmosphere VST?
 
Creating atmospheric sounds with Atmosphere VST is easy and fun. Here are some steps to get you started:
 
1. Launch Atmosphere VST and select a preset from the browser. You can browse by category, such as Pads, Textures, or Soundscapes, or by mood, such as Dark, Bright, or Mysterious. You can also use the search function to find a specific sound by name or keyword.
2. Play some notes on your MIDI keyboard or controller and listen to how the sound responds. You can adjust the volume, pan, tuning, and glide of each sound using the sliders on the main panel.
3. Use the filter section to shape the tone of the sound. You can choose from low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, or notch filters, and adjust the cutoff frequency and resonance. You can also use the envelope generator to modulate the filter cutoff over time.
4. Use the LFO section to add some movement and variation to the sound. You can choose from different waveforms, such as sine, triangle, square, or random, and adjust the rate and depth of the modulation. You can also sync the LFO to your host tempo for rhythmic effects.
5. Use the modulation matrix to assign different sources and destinations for modulation. For example, you can modulate the pitch of a sound with an LFO, or modulate the filter cutoff with an envelope. You can use up to four modulation routings per sound.
6. Layer up to four sounds together for more complex sonic combinations. You can use the mixer section to adjust the level and pan of each layer, and use the solo and mute buttons to isolate or silence each layer. You can also use the edit button to access more parameters for each layer.
7. Save your custom sound as a new preset using the save button. You can name your preset and assign it to a category and mood for easy recall later.
